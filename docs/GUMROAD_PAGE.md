# 🧱 BuildStamp — Embed Build Metadata in Every Build

##### Embed your project’s DNA.
BuildStamp automatically injects version, commit, and timestamp information into your builds — so you always know what you’re running, when it was built, and from where.

## 💡 What It Does

BuildStamp is a zero-dependency CLI tool that tags every build with precise metadata:

- ✅ Version (from AutoVersion or manually)

- 🕓 Timestamp (ISO-8601 UTC format)

- 🌿 Git branch and commit hash

- 🏷️ Custom release tags (e.g. nightly, beta, internal)

- 📦 Multiple output formats: JSON, C#, Markdown, Text

It fits into any .NET, Unity, or PowerShell project — or any build pipeline — to generate self-documenting artifacts.

## 🚀 Perfect For

- 💻 Solo devs managing versioned releases

- 🏢 Teams using CI/CD pipelines (GitHub, GitLab, Azure)

- 🕹️ Unity developers who want visible version info in-game

- 🧱 Toolmakers embedding version info in CLI apps

- 🧠 DevOps engineers seeking reproducible builds

## ⚡ How It Works
```
buildstamp --out ./Builds/buildinfo.json

```

Output:
```
{
  "project": "AutoVersion.Lite",
  "version": "0.7.2",
  "branch": "main",
  "commit": "f62b7e3",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-04T15:42:11Z"
}

```

Or inject into C#:
```
buildstamp --format cs --out ./src/BuildInfo.cs
```

Result:
```
// Auto-generated by BuildStamp
internal static class BuildInfo {
    public const string Version = "0.7.2";
    public const string Commit = "f62b7e3";
    public const string Timestamp = "2025-11-04T15:42:11Z";
}
```
